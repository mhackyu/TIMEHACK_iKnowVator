      Have you made a New Year's Resolution to be smarter with your money this 2019?
      Have you ever tried money tracking apps?

      While money tracking apps have many useful features, it's not as easy to form a habit to open an app to log every single little financial transaction we've
      made throughout the day. After a while, we'll start skipping smaller and faster transactions, and once the logs are too outdated, the app and the habit will
      soon be forgotten.

      Chatting is natural to us, no matter where we are, no mater what we're doing. We can always make time to send one message to a friend or loved one.

      iKnowVator wants to help the modern Filipino keep track of their expenses as easy as talking to an old friend.

      Our proposal is the iKnowVator FinanceBot, where your assistant, Sabrina, will help you keep track of your finances anywhere, anytime.

      Tell her:
      what you ate
      where you ate
      what you bought
      where you went

      plus how much you spent, and she'll keep track of all your expenses, even incomes!

      Also, Sabrina can help you keep track of your budgets and savings goals. Just tell her how much you need to track up until a certain date.

      Best of all, you can tell Sabrina all your transactions the same way you would a normal friend.
      She can track in a single sentence how much you spent and where she should categorize your input.
      She'll also give you daily reports of how much you spent, how much you've earned, and how far along you are with your savings goal and budget for the day.


      So what are you waiting for? Try out iKnowVator's FinanceBot today! (Chatbot beta is available if you want a sneak peek of Sabrina's capabilities)
